What does the return type of a function indicate?
     - The type of the return defines the kind of data that can be returned and
       it defines and constrains the data type of the value returned from a subroutine or method.

What does returning void mean?
     -Void means that the method does not return any values. If a method does not have void, it must return something (int, String, double, etc.)
      A function that returns void is essentially one that doesn't return anything.
